# PRIVIMAGE
PRIVIMAGE is a Differetial Privacy (DP) image generation tool, which leverages the DP technique to generate synthetic data to replace the sensitive data, allowing organizations to share and utilize synthetic images without privacy concerns.
# Requirements
PRIVIMAGE is built using PyTorch 2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8. Please use the following command to install the requirements:
```
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
# Pre-trained Checkpoint
We provide pre-trained checkpoints for all models presented in the paper here. You can sample from the checkpoint using the following command:
